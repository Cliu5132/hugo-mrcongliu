> A quote from Twitter: "The best developers are those who keep learning new technologies even when nobody is watching, and enjoy the process."

### The Inevitable

The more I delve into the job market, the more I realize the importance of continuously acquiring new skills and knowledge in technology.

When I browse job postings, I notice that there are fewer positions labeled "Junior Developer". Instead, the most common roles are "Senior Developers," which demand a higher level of domain expertise and offer greater benefits and compensation.

I still see myself as a junior software developer. But how can a junior developer secure a job in a market that doesn't seem to prioritize junior positions? The answer is quite simple: keep learning and keep searching. As you learn, your skills will improve. Before long, a junior developer will progress closer to the level of an intermediate developer. The job market is dynamic and won't remain unfavorable forever. So, when the demand for junior and intermediate developers returns, you want to be well-prepared. You have to be ready.

In recent times, the job market has heavily favored senior developers, and these roles require a wealth of knowledge that may take years to acquire. New frontend libraries, backend engines, DevOps tools, infrastructure as code with Terraform, and similar technologies can seem daunting.


### Efficiency Matters

This leads me to contemplate the art of learning how to learn efficiently. With the limited time available in our human lifespan, we must be mindful of how we allocate it. Personally, I have a full-time job from 9 to 5, which means I need to be strategic in how I use my evenings and weekends. If managed wisely, I can enhance my learning significantly, ultimately becoming a better developer, securing a position with a reputable company, and increasing my earnings.

It's essential to acknowledge that everyone's brain, habits, and biological rhythms are unique, so it's crucial to discover what works best for you. In my case, I've discovered that I function most effectively by continually acquiring new knowledge and switching topics every two or three hours; that's just how my brain operates. For example, I might start my day with an hour at the gym, followed by two hours of XCode programming, some cooking, a short break or a nap, and then a few hours of Java development. Later, I might take a leisurely walk, watch a comedy show, and conclude my day by writing a blog post.

However, if I neglect my inherent learning preferences and habits, I might find myself delving too deeply into a single topic for an extended period. For instance, if I spend a week immersed in preparing for an AWS exam, I not only lose interest in the exam but also risk forgetting much of my prior knowledge in C# and Java. If I don't revisit these languages for more than a week, they can feel entirely unfamiliar to me. This is where things can go awry.
