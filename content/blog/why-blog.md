To be honest, nobody has to have a blog. You can write your thoughts on paper each day if that's how you enjoy it. But to me, having something online and accessible to the public excites me. That's why I think it would be fulfilling to have https://mrcongliu.com set up and see how far it can go.

This blog has been built via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a super fast library to build blog sites. I was considering using some languages natively to avoid a steep learning curve, like [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). But eventually, I like using a framework designed for writing blogs, so I can focus on the writing part.

I've been learning how to write essays since elementary school. My mother paid a fortune hiring a retired Chinese literature professor to have one-on-one meetings with me on weekends. Those days were hard and less enjoyable back then. I believe at some point in my early years I could write well-structured essays, but not today, definitely.

It is foreseeable that writing skills would deteriorate over time as a full-time software developer. Not only are memories lost in the wind, but also my knowledge (both technical and non-technical) is lost if not noted in time. Then I thought it would be a good idea to write them down so I don't lose them, even if nobody would read that.

Therefore, here comes the website.
