On my day one at work, my supervisor asked me to pull in our repository and run `docker-compose up` inside the root folder. Then everything was ready: frontEnd, backEnd, database, caching. Despite the part of terrified by the logs thrown all over the screen, I was quite curious about what Docker was. This curiosity continued for over a year until I was thrown into a DevOps role to do a maintanance on our Lambda services.

If I can go back in time and talk to the younger myself, I would say that you should start learning Docker as early as possible. It is so neat and will help you through out your career as a software developer. In terms of learning resources, the Docker official introduction is the best place to start.

Here are a few steps to grasp the basics of Docker.

### Download Docker Desktop

Go to [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/) and download Docker Desktop.

There are a few versions out there, but I won't bother using anyone other than the desktop version. If your system doesn't compile with it, consider switch your machine.
